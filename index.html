         <h2>Living in France</h2>
         <p>Moving to France had been a dream for my parents for years, and finally in February of 2003, we made the
            move!
            We went from a suburb of a city Nottingham, England to a tiny hamlet in rural France called Chamberaud, in
            the Creuse region.
            Of the four of us, only Mum spoke French; my brother and I being young, became fluent in the space of about
            6 months.
            It took a while longer for our Dad, and we took great pleasure in correcting his French, while he claimed he
            was just "checking you're paying attention"
            Our grandparents also moved to France in 2006. Everyone still lives there today; it has been nearly 18 years
            for my parents and brother!</p>

         <h3>Winters in La Creuse</h3>
         <p>Winter was always fun for us! We would often have snow, and made lots of snow angels, snowmen, but more
            importantly, sledding!
            Opposite our house was a short steep hill that we always sledded down. One year some family and close
            friends came for a surprise visit.
            A few hours after their arrival, it started snowing, and continued throughout the night. As kids, we were
            thrilled, the parents, not so much!
            We were constantly in and out, the floor was covered in newspaper to attempt to soak up the melting snow,
            there was gloves and clothes drying on radiators everywhere.</p>

         </figure>
         <br>
         <p>There were a few notable winters, but the worst was 2007. The snow came down so thick and heavy, and then it
            froze. The trees were so laden I don't know how they didn't break. We actually ended up being without
            electricity for a week. In some villages it was up to 2 weeks. For us this meant we had no heating in most
            of our house, the living room had a wood burner that we used to stay warm!

            <figcaption>Lots of snow!</figcaption>
         </figure>
         <br>
         <h3>Summer's fantastic too!</h3>
         <p>That's enough about winter, summers were always amazing. In fact the year we moved there was a heatwave in
            August, with temperatures reaching a whopping 41&deg;C, or 104&deg;F. These were the highest temperatures in
            50 years!</p>
         <p>Summers were usually filled with lots of exploring the local woods. I spent many days and hours biking and
            discovering new trails. All roads lead to Rome, so I never got lost. My brother and I occasionally helped
            the local farmers move cows from one field to another, which was always good fun, and something that we
            would never have had a chance to do in England! Some of our friends also owned a farm. We learned to milk
            the cows, pick chicken eggs and drive tractors. My friend Aurore could drive a Jeep by the time she was 11
            (yep, even on the roads sometimes from one field to another, oops!)

         <br>
         <h3>Autumn with a Halloween bonus</h3>
         <p>Autumn is also lovely here, there's so many trees and they're all changing colors! More importantly we can
            go foraging for mushrooms, hazelnuts, chestnuts and sometimes walnuts. The spooky season was good to us
            also! The first few years we were there, the locals organized a trick and treating event. We'd meet up and a
            big group of kids anywhere from ages 4 to 12 (ish) would spend all day trick and treating around the local
            villages. When we were done we met up in the tiny town hall, put all the candy together, weigh it and split
            it evenly. We were usually set until next Halloween!</p>

         <h2>A bit about La Creuse</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Aubusson</li>
            <li>Moutier d'Ahun</li>
            <li>Chamberaud</li>
         </ul>
         <p>The Creuse is an agricultural area, that's particularly rural with the lowest population in the country at
            about 117,000 people. That being said, it is a beautiful area, with a mix of hills, fields, forests and a
            main river, after which the region is named. There's many very old buildings, ranging from small castles to
            bridges.</p>

         <img src="images/Creuse/Creusephoto.jpg" alt="View of the Creuse" width="650" height="350">
         <p>In the spring of 1889, the artist Monet spent some time painting in the Creuse. He included many of those
            scenes in an exhibition in Paris during that summer.</p>

         </figure>
         <br>
         <h3>Aubusson</h3>
         <p>Aubusson is a larger town nestled in a valley, following the flow of the river. Since it's a relatively
            popular tourist spot, the town is well kept and is particularly beautiful during the summer with it's bright
            colors. The streets are tiny and often paved with cobblestones.</p>
         <figure>
            <img src="images/Aubusson/AubussonCobblestone.jpg" alt="Aubusson Street" width="500" height="360">

            <figcaption>Photos of the town. <small>I couldn't find a watermark free photo, much sadness. </small>
            </figcaption>
         </figure>

         <p>The town is estimated to have been established during the Roman Empire, although it has a more medieval
            feel. It's been famous for it's tapestries
            since the 14th century. In the 17th century they became the official royal tapestry crafters. They still
            make a some and recently an agreement was signed with the Tolkien Estate to create a <a
               href="https://www.cite-tapisserie.fr/en/contemporary-creation/aubusson-weaves-tolkien" target="_blank">
               new series.</a>
            Mostly, they repair old tapestries and old upholstered chairs. It can actually be difficult to repair them,
            since the colors have faded and it's hard to tell exactly which color it is.</p>

         <br>
         <h3>Moutier d'Ahun</h3>
         <p>This small village is set next to the Creuse river. It's home to a roman bridge! Once upon a time this area
            and bridge was essential to the romans, as several roads led there; it also allowed them to communicate
            better and travel between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saintes,_Charente-Maritime"
               target="_blank">Saintes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon" target="_blank">Lyon.</a>
            The bridge has had repairs performed on it, and had to be reconstructed in the 11th century; however, it is
            still called a roman bridge.

            <p>My Mum had a pen pal when she was young, they kept in touch and we have become extended family, they are
               from around the Lyon area!</p>
            <p>I visited Saintes with some friends, coincidentally my parents visited it recently and saw the same
               church I did when I went. </p>

         </p>
         <br>
         <p>The moutier is also home to a fantastic abbey founded in 997 and dedicated to Mary, mother of Jesus. <a
               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedictines" target="_blank">Benedictines monks</a> lived there
            until the French revolution around 1790. During the <a
               href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerre_de_Cent_Ans" target="_blank">Hundred year war</a> they had to
            rebuild parts of the abbey, and again during the <a

         <br>
         <h3>ChÃ¢teau de Villemonteix</h3>
         <p>As I said previously there are also castles in this area. They aren't necessarily as big as traditional castles. A local one to us is the castle of Villemonteix, built during the 15th century. It has been classed as a historical monument since the 1940s. It is privately owned but open to the public and serves as a sort of museum.</p>

         <br>
         <h3>Honorable mention</h3>
         <p>We used to live opposite (kind of) the church in our hamlet. We even named our house "Beautiful view of the
            church" (Belle vue de l'&Eacute;glise). It was built around 1282 and was used by Templars.</p>
