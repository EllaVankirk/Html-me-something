         <h2 class="title"><a id="Living"></a>Living in France</h2>
         <article>
         <p id="introduction">Moving to France had been a dream for my parents for years, and finally in February of 2003, we made the
            move!
            We went from a suburb of a city Nottingham, England to a tiny hamlet in rural France called Chamberaud,
            in
            the Creuse region.<br>
            Of the four of us, only Mum spoke French; my brother and I being young, became fluent in the space of
            about
            6 months.
            It took a while longer for our Dad, and we took great pleasure in correcting his French, while he claimed
            he
            was just "checking you're paying attention".
            Our grandparents also moved to France in 2006. Everyone still lives there today; it has been nearly 18
            years
            for my parents and brother!</p>

         <h3><a id="Winter"></a>Winters in La Creuse</h3>
         <figure class="right">
            <img src="images/Winter/Snowball.JPG" alt="Snowball family" width="600" height="400">
            <figcaption class="smalltext">Epic snowball fight!</figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p class="lefttext">Winter was always fun for us! We would often have snow, and made lots of snow angels, snowmen, but more
            importantly, sledding!
            Opposite our house was a short steep hill that we always sledded down. One year some family and close
            friends came for a surprise visit.
            A few hours after their arrival, it started snowing, and continued throughout the night. As kids, we were
            thrilled, the parents, not so much!
            We were constantly in and out, the floor was covered in newspaper to attempt to soak up the melting snow,
            there was gloves and clothes drying on radiators everywhere.</p>
        
         <br>
         <p class="under">There were a few notable winters, but the worst was 2007. The snow came down so thick and heavy, and then
            it
            froze. The trees were so laden I don't know how they didn't break. We actually ended up being without
            electricity for a week. In some villages it was up to 2 weeks. For us this meant we had no heating in
            most
            of our house, the living room had a wood burner that we used to stay warm!

         <h3><a id="Summer"></a><a href="index.html">Summer's fantastic too!</a></h3>
         <p>That's enough about winter! It's summertime, yay! The year we moved there was a heatwave (boooo) in
            August, with temperatures reaching a whopping 41&deg;C, or 104&deg;F. These were the highest temperatures
            in
            50 years!</p>
         <p>Summers were usually filled with lots of exploring the local woods. I spent many days and hours biking
            and
            discovering new trails. All roads lead to Rome, so I never got lost. My brother and I occasionally helped
            the local farmers move cows from one field to another, which was always good fun, and something that we
            would never have had a chance to do in England! Some of our friends also owned a farm. We learned to milk
            the cows, pick chicken eggs and drive tractors. My friend Aurore could drive a Jeep by the time she was
            11
            (yep, even on the roads sometimes from one field to another, oops!)

            also! The first few years we were there, the locals organized a trick and treating event. We'd meet up
            and a
            big group of kids anywhere from ages 4 to 12 (ish) would spend all day trick and treating around the
            local
            villages. When we were done we met up in the tiny town hall, put all the candy together, weigh it and
            split
            it evenly. We were usually set until next Halloween!</p>

            <p>The Creuse is an agricultural area, that's particularly rural with the lowest population in the country

            about 117,000 people. That being said, it is a beautiful area, with a mix of hills, fields, forests and a
            main river, after which the region is named. There's many very old buildings, ranging from small castles
            to
            bridges.</p>

            Mostly, they repair old tapestries and old upholstered chairs. It can actually be difficult to repair them,

            The bridge has had repairs performed on it, and had to be reconstructed in the 11th century; however, it is
            still called a roman bridge.

            castles. A local one to us is the castle of Villemonteix, built during the 15th century. It has been classed
            as a historical monument since the 1940s. It is privately owned but open to the public and serves as a sort
            of museum.</p>
