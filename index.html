       <p>Moving to France had been a dream for my parents for years, and finally in February of 2003, we made the move! 
         We went from a suburb of a city Nottingham, England to a tiny hamlet in rural France called Chamberaud.
         Of the four of us, only Mum spoke french; my brother and I being young, became fluent in the space of about 6 months. Unfortunately for Dad,
         the struggle was real, it was a source of great amusment for us as children, and Dad was frequently "checking we were paying attention".
         Thankfully, in the last few years his french has come a long way and is now fluent (it was about time, they've been there nearly 18 years!).
