         <h2>Living in France</h2>
         <p>Moving to France had been a dream for my parents for years, and finally in February of 2003, we made the
            move!
            We went from a suburb of a city Nottingham, England to a tiny hamlet in rural France called Chamberaud, in
            the Creuse region.
            Of the four of us, only Mum spoke French; my brother and I being young, became fluent in the space of about
            6 months.
            It took a while longer for our Dad, and we took great pleasure in correcting his French, while he claimed he
            was just "checking you're paying attention"
            Our grandparents also moved to France in 2006. Everyone still lives there today; it has been nearly 18 years
            for my parents and brother!</p>

         <h3>Winters in La Creuse</h3>
         <p>Winter was always fun for us! We would often have snow, and made lots of snow angels, snowmen, but more
            importantly, sledding!
            Opposite our house was a short steep hill that we always sledded down. One year some family and close
            friends came for a surprise visit.
            A few hours after their arrival, it started snowing, and continued throughout the night. As kids, we were
            thrilled, the parents, not so much!
            We were constantly in and out, the floor was covered in newspaper to attempt to soak up the melting snow,
            there was gloves and clothes drying on radiators everywhere.</p>

         <br>
         <p>There were a few notable winters, but the worst was 2007. The snow came down so thick and heavy, and then it
            froze. The trees were so laden I don't know how they didn't break. We actually ended up being without
            electricity for a week. In some villages it was up to 2 weeks. For us this meant we had no heating in most
            of our house. Fortunately

         <br>
         <h3>Summer's fantastic too!</h3>
         <p>That's enough about winter, summers were always amazing. In fact the year we moved there was a heatwave in
            August, with temperatures reaching a whopping 41&deg;C, or 104&deg;F. These were the highest temperatures in
            50 years!</p>
         <p>Summers were usually filled with lots of exploring the local woods. I spent many days and hours biking and
            discovering new trails. All roads lead to Rome, so I never got lost. My brother and I occasionally helped
            the local farmers move cows from one field to another, which was always good fun, and something that we
            would never have had a chance to do in England! Some of our friends also owned a farm. We learned to milk
            the cows, pick chicken eggs and drive tractors. My friend Aurore could drive a Jeep by the time she was 11
            (yep, even on the roads sometimes from one field to another, oops!)
