            <h2>Living in France</h2>
               <p>Moving to France had been a dream for my parents for years, and finally in February of 2003, we made the move! 
         We went from a suburb of a city Nottingham, England to a tiny hamlet in rural France called Chamberaud, in the Creuse region.
         Of the four of us, only Mum spoke french; my brother and I being young, became fluent in the space of about 6 months.
         It took a while longer for our Dad, and we took great pleasure in correcting his french, while he claimed he was just "checking you're paying attention"
         Our grandparents also moved to France in 2006. Everyone still lives there today; it has been nearly 18 years for my parents and brother!

               <p>2004 Was eventful for us! A large group of friends and family came to visit, literally hours after they arrived at our house, it started snowing! We were thrilled, especially the kids.
         It continued to snow through the night and the next day we had an epic snowball fight! .</p>

            <h2>Holiday in America</h2>
               <p>In November 2004, we had the trip of a lifetime! Our grandma spoiled the four of us, my cousin Gemma and my Uncle to a trip to Disney in Florida. For two whole weeks we had a villa to ourselves.
         We had spent all of our spare time in the swimming pool, and visited lots of attractions.</p>
