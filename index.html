       <h1>Moving to France</h1>
       <p>In February 2003, my family and I moved from England to a beautiful area in France called La Creuse. 
          Since we were driving from England to France, we stayed in a quaint bed and breakfast for one night. 
          The area was experiencing one of it's coldest winters with temperatures going down to 6°F( or -14°C);
          since the house didn't have central heating, we quickly snuggled in our beds, under the covers with hot water bottles. 
          The next morning we got up for an early start and discovered a frozen coke bottle that we tried to defrost in the sunlight while 
          finishing up the second leg of our trip.
