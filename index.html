            <h2>Living in France</h2>
            <p>Moving to France had been a dream for my parents for years, and finally in February of 2003, we made the move! 
         We went from a suburb of a city Nottingham, England to a tiny hamlet in rural France called Chamberaud, in the Creuse region.
         Of the four of us, only Mum spoke french; my brother and I being young, became fluent in the space of about 6 months.
         It took a while longer for our Dad, and we took great pleasure in correcting his french, while he claimed he was just "checking you're paying attention"
         Our grandparents also moved to France in 2006. Everyone still lives there today; it has been nearly 18 years for my parents and brother!</p>

            <h3>Winters in La Creuse</h3>
               <p>Winter was always fun for us! We would often have snow, and made lots of snow angels, snowmen, but more importantly, sledding!
                  Opposite our house was a short steep hill that we always sledded down. One year some family and close friends came for a surpise visit.
                  A few hours after their arrival, it started snowing, and continued throughout the night. As kids, we were thrilled, the parents, not so much!
                  We were constantly in and out, the floor was covered in newspaper to attempt to soak up the melting snow, there was gloves and clothes drying on radiators everywhere.</p>

               <p>There were a few notable winters, but the worst was 2007. The snow came down so thick and heavy, and then it froze. The trees were so laden I don't know how they didnt break. We actually ended up being without electricity for a week. In some villages it was up to 2 weeks. For us this meant we had no heating in most of our house. Fortuntely
